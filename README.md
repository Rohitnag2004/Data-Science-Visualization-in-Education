# Data Science & Visualization in Education

## 📌 Introduction
This project explores the role of **data science** and **visualization** in the education sector.  
It demonstrates how data-driven insights can improve student performance analysis, curriculum design, and personalized learning.  
The work combines **theoretical foundations**, **practical tools**, and **real-world applications** to present a holistic view of this research area.  


## 🎯 Objectives
- Explain the **theory** behind data science (statistics, ML, algorithms).  
- Review **tools & technologies** such as Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), R, Tableau, and Power BI.  
- Explore **applications in education** including learning analytics dashboards, predictive modeling, and personalized learning.  
- Present **case studies** (e.g., Georgia State University dropout reduction, LearningViz dashboard).  
- Highlight **challenges** like data privacy, bias, and interpretation issues.  
- Discuss **future trends** such as AI-powered visualization, real-time analytics, and AR/VR.
